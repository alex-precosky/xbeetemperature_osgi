# xbeetemperature_osgi
This is a module for Eclipse Kura 3.1 for taking XBee sensor readings and putting them on MQTT.
It's probably not for general use as-is since it's pretty specific to my application, but would be a handy 
starting point for anyone interested in using Kura as a gateway in their IoT application
where they want to put values in a MySQL or other database.

It implements the ConfigurableComponent interface, letting you set it up through the Kura web interface.

It uses the Kura CloudService to publish to the MQTT topic

## Requirements

* Eclipse Kura 3.1
* MQTT Server
* Periodic sensor values coming from a serial port


## Building

### OSGi .jar file bundle for testing

* In Eclipse, right click on the project and choose Export.  Select Plug-in Development - Deployable plug-ins and fragments.
Select the project and click Finish.  

## Deployment

The .jar file bundle of the project needs to be built first, as above.  Then, find the .dpp file in the Eclipse project structure, 
under resources/dp.  Open it and it will update its configuration to use the newly built .jar file.  Right click on the .dpp file
and choose Quick Build.  The resulting .dp file can be permanantly deployed by copying it to the gate way under the proper directory, which for my Kura installation was /opt/eclipse/kura_3.1.0-SNAPSHOT_raspberry-pi-2/kura/packages
